## 2. Introduction

Foundation Models such as GPT-4, AlphaFold, and FunSearch are profoundly transforming how scientific discovery is conducted. Scientific progress has historically unfolded through four foundational paradigms: experimental, theoretical, computational, and data-driven. Each paradigm introduced new modes of inquiry, from systematic observation and mathematical abstraction to simulation-based analysis and large-scale data pattern extraction.

As scientific challenges become increasingly complex, interdisciplinary, and dynamic, the limitations of existing paradigms have become more pronounced. Foundation Models are emerging as versatile systems that integrate reasoning, modeling, language processing, and data generation. These models unify capabilities across domains, enabling end-to-end support for scientific processes including literature review, hypothesis generation, experiment design, and interpretation of results.

This position paper argues that Foundation Models are not merely tools for speeding up existing workflows. They are actively reshaping the underlying structure of scientific practice. We introduce a three-stage framework that captures this ongoing transformation:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./scientific research paradigm.png" alt="Figure 1: Paradigm Transition via FMs" width="800"/>
</p>

**Figure 1. Evolving scientific paradigms empowered by FMs. FMs progressively transition from tool-like infrastructure (meta-scientific integration), to interactive co-creators (hybrid humanâ€“AI collaboration), and ultimately to autonomous agents capable of end-to-end scientific discovery.**

In the first stage, Foundation Models function as intelligent infrastructure that improves efficiency within traditional paradigms. In the second stage, they operate as collaborators that participate in research ideation and execution. In the third stage, they may evolve into autonomous agents capable of initiating and completing scientific inquiries with minimal human intervention.

To contextualize this transformation, we trace the historical evolution of scientific paradigms:

<p align="center">
  <img src="scientific research history.png" alt="Figure 2: Scientific Paradigm History" width="500"/>
</p>

**Figure 2. A Roadmap of Scientific Discovery Paradigms and Their Epistemic Capabilities.**

Each new paradigm emerged in response to the limitations of the previous one. The experiment-driven paradigm emphasized empirical validation. The theory-driven paradigm brought deductive abstraction. The computation-driven paradigm enabled exploration of analytically intractable systems. The data-driven paradigm introduced inductive discovery from large-scale observations. Foundation Models now present a fifth paradigm that integrates learning, reasoning, and generation within a unified and adaptable framework.

This paper offers a conceptual roadmap for understanding the trajectory of Foundation Models in science. It highlights not only their technical capacities but also their growing epistemic influence. By positioning these models as active participants in knowledge creation, we invite deeper reflection on what science means in an era of intelligent machines.

## 3. Core Philosophy

### Philosophy

- **Human**: Responsible for framing problems, making final decisions, and maintaining scientific integrity.
- **Foundation Models**: Serve as assistants or collaborators that enhance searching, reasoning, modeling, and writing.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Ensures that human agency, ethical accountability, and critical judgment remain central.

### Objectives

- Increase the efficiency of research workflows such as literature review, experiment design, and scientific writing.
- Improve research quality by supporting structured reasoning and cross-domain knowledge integration.
- Lower the barrier of entry for newcomers to engage in high-quality scientific inquiry.
- Preserve human control and oversight to avoid risks associated with full automation.

## 4. FM-Assisted Scientific Discovery In Practice

FMs are increasingly integrated into every stage of the scientific research workflow, enabling researchers to accelerate and enhance the discovery process. In practice, FMs support a seamless pipeline that spans from the initial exploration of research topics, through comprehensive literature surveys, precise problem formulation, and innovative methodology design, to experimental execution and scientific writing. By leveraging FMs, scientists can efficiently identify emerging trends, synthesize vast bodies of knowledge, refine research questions, design robust experiments, and generate or analyze data. This section illustrates how FMs can be systematically embedded into each step of the scientific process, providing practical examples and recommended tools for each phase.

### 4.1. Topic Exploration

Foundation models assist researchers in identifying emerging topics, knowledge gaps, and interdisciplinary intersections by querying large-scale corpora and structured databases.

**Example**: 

```OpenAI Deep Research
Human: What are the underexplored challenges in protein design in academic research?

AI: [Underexplored Challenges in Protein Design by OpenAI Deep Research]
```

- [Elicit](https://elicit.com/)
- [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)

### 4.2. Literature Survey

FMs summarize academic literature, cluster publications into themes, and highlight influential papers or trends.

**Example**: 

```OpenAI Deep Research
Human: Please help me conduct a literature survey on protein design.

AI: [Survey about protein design by OpenAI Deep Research]
```

See: [Survey about protein design by OpenAI Deep Research](./literature_survey_example.md)

### 4.3. Problem Refinement

FMs enable iterative refinement of research questions based on novelty, feasibility, or scope, offering domain-specific insights and suggestions.

**Example**: 
```OpenAI Deep Research
Human: I intend to design a foundation model-based agent for protein design. Please analyze and refine the research problem.

AI: [Problem Refinement by OpenAI Deep Research]
```

### 4.4. Methodology Design

FMs provide assistance in designing or modifying research methodologies, including experiment protocols, model selection, and variable control strategies.

**Example**: 
```OpenAI Deep Research

**Recommended Tools**:
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/)

### 4.5. Experimentation

FMs generate executable code, simulate experimental conditions, or interact with laboratory robots, enabling rapid testing and iteration.

**Example**:

```ChatGPT
Human: Please generate the corresponding program according to this method: [Method].

AI: [Code generated by ChatGPT]
```

See: [Method](./methodology_design_example.md), [Code generated by ChatGPT](./experimentation_example.md).

### 4.6. Paper Writing and Polishing

FMs assist with outlining, drafting, rewriting, and proofreading scientific papers. They also help generate visuals or translate content between formats.

**Example**: An LLM transforms a collection of experimental logs and plots into a structured LaTeX paper draft, including title suggestions, abstract summaries, and formatted references.

## 6. Summary

This paper proposes a shift from the traditional human-led research process to a future of human-AI collaboration and, eventually, autonomous scientific inquiry. Foundation models are not only improving scientific efficiency but also introducing new epistemic agents capable of participating in, and potentially leading, the generation of scientific knowledge. This transformation calls for a rethinking of research workflows, authorship, accountability, and the future of science itself.
